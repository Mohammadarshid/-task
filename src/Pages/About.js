            The old restaurant was accessible through the Jaleb Chowk, a
            prominent ceremonial opening to the palace precinct through its
            eastern flank. The Chowk and the main seating of the old restaurant
            were connected by the admin officeâ€™s courtyard through a narrow
            opening beside the toilet block, which opened into the courtyard.
            This was used as an opportunity to connect the Palace to a different
            side of the walled city by opening up the courtyard as a connector
            to Jaleb Chowk. The project was undertaken by Studio Lotus as an
            exercise in exploring whether it is more important to recreate a
            version of what was or reveal what lay beneath the layers of paint
            to expose the historic shell and juxtapose that with contemporary
            expressions for traditional material and artisanal skills.
